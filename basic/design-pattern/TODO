https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern
The service locator pattern is a design pattern used in software development to encapsulate the processes
involved in obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer. This pattern uses a central registry
known as the "service locator", which on request returns the information necessary to perform a certain task.
